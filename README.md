# BMI-Calculator
This is a simple Python program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their height and weight. The BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that is used to classify whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the [Python website.](https://www.python.org/)


Once you have Python installed, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine.

## Running the Program
To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the repository. Then, type the following command:

```
python bmi_calculator.py
```
This will start the program and prompt you to enter your height and weight. The program will then calculate your BMI and display it on the screen.

## Example Output
Here is an example of what the output of the program might look like:
```Enter your height (in meters): 1.75
Enter your weight (in kilograms): 75
Your BMI is 24.49. You are Overweight.
```
In this example, the person's BMI is calculated to be 24.49, which is considered to be normal weight.
